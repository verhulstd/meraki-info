      Every small business needs a website. Companies without an online presence
      face an incredibly difficult uphill climb, Because we live in a connected
      world where people discover products, services, and business—even local
      businesses—by searching on the internet. Sure, creating a business website
      may take months of painstaking planning, debating, and compromise, but
      setting up a decent website doesn't have to be painful, provided you have
      the proper tools. And the most important tool is the right web hosting
      service.
