    <h2>Raster Images</h2>
    <p>
      Raster images are made up of lots of little different colored pixels that
      come together to form a complete image. Almost all of the photos found on
      the web and in print are raster images, and JPEGs, GIFs, and PNGs are
      common raster image types
    </p>
    <h2>Vector Images</h2>
    <p>
      Vector images, on the other hand, are constructed using paths that each
      have a mathematical formula, rather than individual pixels. This makes
      them infinitely scalable. Vector images are perfect for things like logos,
      where you would want to use the same image at many different sizes, from
      business cards to billboard
